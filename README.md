# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

This repository contains an implementation of the QR Code Component, originally part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. Unlike the original version, this version has been developed using the Haxe programming language instead of relying purely on HTML, JS, and CSS.

# Haxe Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Haxe and Haxelib adequately set up on your system. If not, please refer to the [Haxe Official Documentation](https://haxe.org/download/) for installation instructions.

After setting up Haxe and Haxelib, install the required libraries:

``
haxelib git jsImport https://github.com/back2dos/jsImport
``

``
haxelib git react https://github.com/Just-Feeshy/haxe-react.git
``

To compile the code to JavaScript:

``
haxe build.hxml
``

# What is Haxe?

Haxe is a high-level, open-source programming language that is both easy to learn and powerful to use. It is versatile, allowing the development of applications and software for various platforms from a single codebase.
